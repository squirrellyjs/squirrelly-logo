# squirrelly-logo
This repository is to contain images and graphic assets for SquirrellyJS.

## Contributing

Graphic design isn't my specialty, and I'd love contributions! Create an issue first and I'll discuss potential changes.


## License
Though Squirrelly itself is under the MIT License, I'm not going to license the Squirrelly logo for now, because I don't want people using it for a business or something.

In short, I probably won't mind if you share Squirrelly on social media, write about it in blog posts, etc. For other uses or questions, create an issue.
